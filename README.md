# RomanNumerals

I spent approximately 3 hrs 50 minutes on this challenge. I finished the main coding in 2 hrs 30 minutes and chose to spend the rest of my time debugging, discovering more about roman numerals and their rules, and organising my code in order to make my solution as accurate and readable as possible.

I coded and ran this code in Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows.

It was not specified whether we should think through the solution prior to beginning the 4-hour time limit, so I spent approximately an hour outside of the limit thinking through my approach.

I'm pretty sure these files alone should work, but Visual Studio creates many extra files. If anything else is needed, please let me know.
