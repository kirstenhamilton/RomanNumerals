# RomanNumerals

I spent approximately 3 hrs 50 minutes on this challenge. I finished the main coding in 2 hrs 30 minutes and chose to spend the rest of my time debugging, researching more about roman numeral syntax, and organising my code in order to make my solution as accurate and readable as possible.

I coded and ran this code in Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows.

In looking up the syntax for numeral M, it was unclear whether or not M was allowed to occur more than 3 times. People seem divided on this topic, so I chose to have it follow the traditional pattern (occuring only 3 times). I also found that roman numerals can extend beyond this assignment's limit of 3999 (if M only occurs 3 times) by placing bars above the basic letters. Because these were not mentioned in the instructions, I chose not to include them.

I'm pretty sure these files alone should work, but Visual Studio creates many extra files. If anything else is needed, please let me know.
